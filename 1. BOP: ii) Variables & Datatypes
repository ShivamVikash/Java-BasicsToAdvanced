1. Basics of Programming

ii) Variables:

                2*(a+b)
      Here,
      2 -> literal => whose values are universal (constannt values which can be changed)
      a,b -> variables => those values which can be changed
      
eg:
a,b,c, JavaBasics, main, print => names of variables or functions => called identifiers 


IDENTIFIERS - These are names given to functions or variables

Identifier Rules:
-Identifiers can start with any alphabets, or underscore(_) or dollar($).
eg: int $ = 24; //Correct

1,2,3,..  'a','b','c',...  '@','*' => these are universal values called literals (constants, character literals)


WHAT HAPPENS IN MEMORY? WHEN A VARIABLE IS CREATED

int a = 10;
int b = 5;
String name = "Tony";

Inside the memory, block of size same as the datatype is created. Each block gets the name of the variable and an address. Address of each block may or may not be contigious.

iii) Datatypes - are used to specify the type of data that is going to be stored in the variable.

Java -  is a typed language, the variable type needs to be specified before storing the data.
(Java, Python, C++ are tyed languages. JavaScript is not a typed language).

Datatypes - 2 types

1. Primitive: Already exists 
i)    byte - 1 byte     [256: -127 to 127]
ii)   short - 2 bytes
iii)  int - 4 bytes     [-2 billion to +2 billion]
iv)   long - 8 bytes
v)    float - 4 bytes
vi)   double - 8 bytes
vii)  char - 2 bytes    [small letters, capitial letters, special symbols: 'a'-'z','A'-'Z','@','$',...]
viii) boolean - 1 byte  [true,false / 0,1]

2. Non-Primitive: Needs to be created by the user
i) String
ii) Array
iii) Class
iv) Object
v) Interface

SYNTAX:

datatype variablename = value;
