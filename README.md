This is my journey of learning java DSA course. Here we will be learning java programming language from basics to advanced.
The flow would be like: 

Basics of Programming:

1) Basics of Programming - Flowcharts & Pseudocode, Variables & Datatypes, Conditional Statements, Operators
2) Loops & Functions - for loops, while loop, do-while loop, Pattern (Basics to Advanced), Functions
3) Arrays - Introduction to arrays, Searching & Sorting - Linear search, Binary search, Selection sort, Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Count sort
4) 2-D Arrays & Strings

Advanced DSA:

5) Problem Solving Techniques - Recursion, Backtracking, Divide & Conquer, Bit Manipulation, Time & Space Complexity, Greedy Algorithms
6) Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)
7) Linear Data Structures: ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks & Queue, Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (BST)
8) Advanced DS: Heaps, Priority Queues, Hashing( Maps & Sets), Trees
9) Dynamic Programming - Graphs, Segment Trees
